Those color variables are for both **light** and **dark** mode. You can change them by [overriding](#overriding) your desired color variables.

## Overriding

In your `globals.css` file you can override the color variables of Pigment UI, but it has to be done for both **light** and **dark** mode.

```css
:root {
  --primary-500: 255 255 0;
}

:root[class="dark"] {
  --primary-500: 0 255 255;
}
```
